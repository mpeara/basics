Steps to Assemble the Jub.Club landing page

First, open index.html file and notice there is just a blank white screen. We're going to change all that and follow the following steps in order to build our first landing page prototype.

1.Find the meta file, and insert the HTML from that file right after the frist <head> tag on the page.

2. Find the css file, and insert the HTML from that file after the meta data from step one.

3. Go to the html file and insert the HTML from that file in between the <body> </body> tags on your page.

4. Got to the scripts file and insert the HTML from that file in after the </body> tag

5. You have successfully added all of the components to your page so that you can now run jub.club locally.

NOTE: If you press Command-Shift-C (Control on PC), and navigate to your your "Console", you will see some errors. This is due to the fact that you are making an API call to a server to get the the country the user is in. However, you cannot make AJAX API calls from your local computer. You will need to upload this to your server and set up your database in order to do that. 

Good job, you have set up a lnading page and seen the main components that go into a landing page (or any site for that matter: meta data, css, html in your body, and javascript or "script files").
